I am a PhD student starting from September 2024, supervised by [Prof. Chenhui Li](http://chenhui.li/) at the [Shanghai Institute of AI Education, East China Normal University](https://aiedu.ecnu.edu.cn/), and also working with the InternLM team led by [Dr. Qipeng Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k3mPGKgAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) and Shanghai Innovation Institute. I completed my Academic Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology at East China Normal University supervised by [Prof. Chenhui Li](http://chenhui.li/)  and Prof. Changbo Wang (2021-2024) and my undergraduate studies in Mathematics & Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at East China University of Science and Technology (2017-2021). My research focuses on cross-modal LLM Agents, multimodal image editing, and computer graphics. I have served as a reviewer for top-tier conferences including IEEE VIS and CVPR.
